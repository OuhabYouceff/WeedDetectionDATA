The dataset includes 11160 images.
CarpetWeeds-CrabGrass-Eclipta are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -35째 to +35째 horizontally and -27째 to +27째 vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -21 and +21 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 4 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5.56 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -40 and +40 percent
